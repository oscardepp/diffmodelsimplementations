This repo contains several different implementations of Diffusion models that we have been experimenting with over the last couple months. These include SDEs, DDIM, DDPM, and different score objectives, as well as noise schedules.

This repo also includes a 200-slide presentation that I've made from score-based generative models (custom made slides), showing that the noise and score matching objectives are the same, score-matching, the SDE formulation for diffusion models, Langevin dynamics, and then by using Fokker-Planck physics intuition to convert the SDE to an ODE.
